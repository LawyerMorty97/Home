# Home for Homebridge
> A face for the embedded

Home is an application for Homebridge users that let's them control their embedded devices via their computers. While Apple has a native Home application on all macOS devices running macOS Mojave and newer, Windows users are left in the dark. Well no more, this 'Home' app aims to bring most features to the masses.

# FAQ
To use this program, you'll have to have an MQTT broker active. I recommend installing one onto a Raspberry Pi (or on the same device running Homebridge) as this makes things less complicated. Below are links that are helpful to getting MQTT setup on Raspberry Pi
- [Homebridge MQTT Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-mqtt)
